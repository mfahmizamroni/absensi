# TheAdmin Demo

This directory includes all the demo and pages of TheAdmin template. While we suggest you to visit the online demo, you can run a server here and browse the demo file. Also, you have access to source files (SCSS and Javascript) to modify and create your own template.

## Run the server

Install `Node` and `grunt-cli` if they are not installed before:

1. [Download and install Node](https://nodejs.org/download)
2. Install the Grunt command line tools, with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Then, open your command line in this directory and run following commands:

1. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run Grunt with `grunt`.

After few seconds, you'll see a new tab opened in your default browser with a URL like this: <http://localhost:3000> (protocol might be different number). You're able to browse all files.
